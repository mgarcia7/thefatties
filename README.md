Plan of attack for 2D image analysis:
- use MATLAB to separate out lipid droplets from background (aka the hard part)
- pass MATLAB array to ImageJ array
- use ImageJ to analyze particles

# MATLAB GOALS:

# Steps..
- Do this with 2D sample image created by Marge in Paint
- Then, attempt to do this on cropped sample
- Then, full sample and/or other images provided by Tyler
- Not sure how'd we do it in 3D tbvh
